## About Apian

>Apian is a blockchain-compatible code framework and protocol for the management of shared data in highly interactive multi-user applications - games in particular. Apian is complete, flexible, and extensible, and provides a developer the ability to go from idea to prototype without having to spend 2/3 of her time on support infrastructure.

Clear as mud, right? [Check here](https://apian-framework.github.io/Start-Here/) for a more complete overview.



## TLDR; I just want to build and run something...

While you can certainly build the Apian .NET support libraries, they don't *do* anything by themselves and so it wouldn't be very much fun.

Your best bet is to clone the [source release repo](https://github.com/Apian-Framework/Beam-Releases) for the Beam demo application. The you can select a release branch and build and run the Beam.Cli console version of the app, or if you have Unity 3D installed you can build and run Beam.Unity.

But if you really do just want to fetch and build the Apian Framework repositories individually, look [here](install/README.md)

## What *are* all of these repositories?
