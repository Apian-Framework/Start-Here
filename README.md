## About Apian

>Apian is a blockchain-compatible code framework and protocol for the management of shared data in highly interactive multi-user applications - games in particular. Apian is complete, flexible, and extensible, and provides a developer the ability to go from idea to prototype without having to spend 2/3 of her time on support infrastructure.

Clear as mud, right? [Check here](what-is-apian) for a more complete overview.



## TLDR; I just want to build and run something...

While you can certainly build the Apian .NET support libraries, they don't *do* anything by themselves and so it wouldn't be very much fun.

Your best bet at the moment to visit the [Beam.Unity](https://github.com/Apian-Framework/Beam.Unity) and/or [Beam.Cli](https://github.com/Apian-Framework/Beam.Cli) repositories and follow the build instructions there.



## What *are* all of these repositories?
