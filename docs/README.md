## Sorry. These are not the docs you're looking for.

Turns out in order to deploy a [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) website for a 
repository the content _must_ be either in the repo's root folder or a subfolder called `/docs`.

So... this filder does not, in fact, contain any actual docs. 

Sorry.
